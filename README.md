The Study Planner API is a Python-based RESTful service for managing users, subjects, study plans, sessions, and progress, leveraging MySQL as the database. It provides endpoints for creating, reading, and managing data with JSON responses. To use, clone the repository, install mysql-connector-python, configure the database settings in the Db_CONFIG section, and run the server. You can interact with the API via tools like Postman or curl for seamless study planning and tracking.
